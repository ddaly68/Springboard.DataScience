Springboard.DataScience

The excerises contained in this repository are related to Springboard's coursework. It contains the following:


	1) I am tying this to the section 4.2.4. of the Springboard curriculum Working with Data in Files - Project: Work on JSON Based Data Exercises 
	   and Submit on Your Github.  Here I have uploaded the modified Jupyter Workbook with my added code as well as 2 data files, world_bank_projects.json 
	   and  world_bank_projects_less.json.
	   This IPython notebook showcases JSON parsing and data wrangling. It aims to answer the following questions:
		A. Find the 10 countries with most projects.
		B. Find the top 10 major project themes (using column 'mjtheme_namecode').
		C. In 2. above you will notice that some entries have only the code and the name is missing. Create a dataframe with the missing names filled in.

# Capstone Proposal

1) What is the problem you want to solve?
   Home credit default risk - Can you predict how capable each applicant is of repaying a loan?
   
2) Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client 
   DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldn’t have otherwise?
   
   The bank is my client, they will decide whether or not to approve a loan based on previous crdeit 
   performance as well as other factors.
   
3) What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?
	
   This Kaggle competition has 8 different data files:
   application trianing data set 
   application test data set
   credit bureau information
   credit bureau monthly balance information
   point of sale and cash loan history with Home Credit
   crdit card balance information
   previous appllication history
   installment paymet history

4) In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).
   
   Try and determine the ability of each applicant based on credit rating, previous application histry, and 
   revolving credit balance to come up with a risk factor.  Tie this risk factor to the know data set.
   
5) What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or a slide deck.
   Jupyter notebook with detailed notes.
